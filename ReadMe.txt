HttpQuery v1.1
==============

Introduction
------------

This is a simple GUI based tool for making HTTP requests against web servers. It
is designed to allow you full control over the headers and content which is more
useful with REST style APIs these days.

I wrote it as a diagnostic tool to help understand how proxies and gateways were
interfering with the traffic from a real-time service I was working on at the
time.
